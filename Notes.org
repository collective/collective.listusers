*** DONE excel vs csv
CLOSED: [2011-12-28 Wed 20:22]

renaming .csv to .xls and opening with ooffice still feels like a csv
but in binary
*** DONE order groups in table alphabetically

*** DONE additional widget for user attr filtering
CLOSED: [2011-12-28 Wed 20:25]
- based on user attribute that hooks up to a vocabulary
- registry should be able to configure vocabulary (maybe a string or
  dropdown if it's not too much work)
- display widget if and if vocabulary is defined
- registry for which user attribute to filter with
not tested yet
** Questions
*** DONE vcard needs further specification
CLOSED: [2012-01-18 Wed 14:21]
