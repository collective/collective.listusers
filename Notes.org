* Issues
** TODO configuration registry table colums
configure selected attributes and order
enable/disable widget for changing table columns
** TODO exclude AuthenticatedUsers from groups
for the selection widget as well as for table column
** TODO exclude vcard name from csv and copy-to-clipboard
** TODO dedicated permission collective.listusers.ListUsers
** TODO excel vs csv
currently has same name

renaming .csv to .xls and opening with ooffice still feels like a csv
but in binary
* Questions
** TODO vcard needs further specification
only visible fields or all available fields?
* Future
** TODO dragndrop selection of table columns
** TODO double click moves to other column
